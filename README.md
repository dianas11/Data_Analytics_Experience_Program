# Data_Analytics_Experience_Program

This repository will contain all my work and tasks that I'll be doing in the Data Analytics Experience Program By Entry Level.
For starters let me introduce you to the business problem and datasets

## Task 1

### Read the Business Problem below.

Youâ€™re a Data Analyst working for the education tech company Udemy. You have been asked by your manager, Head of Curriculum at Udemy, to present the data on course revenue, 
and you have been provided with data on courses from different topics to understand where opportunities to increase revenue may lie, and track the performance of courses.

Your manager has suggested encouraging Web Development courses to charge more because she believes that these are the most popular courses.
She needs to send a report to the CEO in the next three weeks on how they will increase their next quarterly earnings.



#### What is the business problem?

The business problem as stated by the stakeholder is how can they increase their quarterly sales and what category of courses should be promoted in order to boost their earnings.  
The manager has also added that we should charge more of the Web Development courses because according to her these were more popular among the learners. 



#### What data should be collected to understand this problem? How should it be presented?

* Data related to every category of courses should be collected. 
* Data regarding the number of people who sign up for the courses and pattern do they follow in enrolling for the courses.
* Data should be presented in both a fact and dimension table for better clarity and understanding.


####  What questions would you ask to better understand the business problem?

* What would be the targeted quarterly revenue.
* What type of courses are people most likely to enroll.
* If a person is signing up for a certain course, what according to them would be a follow up course.
* Which course category has the most number of subscribers.
* Which course charges the most and how many subscribers does it have?
